Dengue is the most dangerous disease, feared by the Sri Lankans. Now, the health authorities can seek the help of a team from Queensland experts who had done the experiment. The landmark experiment saw more than 80 percent of deadly disease-carrying mosquitoes being wiped out from an Australian town. Scientists sterilized millions of killer Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, considered one of the world's most dangerous pests. The results of the experiment see the Australian team now hoping they have a way of tackling the insects which are spreading across the world with global warming. Millions of people around the world are infected each year by the mosquito, which can carry dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, among other killer bugs. Zika is an 'urgent' threat to humanity, while the other two pose 'major' danger, says the World Health Organization. Australian researchers purposely bred around 20 million non-biting male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for the experiment. The mosquitoes, which have white markings on their legs, were then infected with the Wolbachia bacteria, which renders them sterile. The killer insects, which have white markings on their legs, were infected with the Wolbachia bacteria, which renders them sterile. Scientists released them into the wild at trial sites around Innisfail, a town with a population of around 7,000 in northern Queensland. Over the course of three months, they mated with females who laid eggs that did not hatch - causing the population to plummet. The trial, described as a victory by the researchers, was funded by Google's parent company Alphabet. It was led by experts from The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and James Cook University. Speaking about the study, Dr. Kyran Staunton, a researcher involved in the study from James Cook University, said, \u201cWe learned a lot from collaborating on this first topical trial.\u201d He further added, \u201cWe're excited to see how this approach might be applied in other regions where Aedes aegypti poses a threat to life and health.\u201d The process, known as the Sterile Insect Technique has been used successfully by scientists since the 1950s. But this was the first time researchers had been able to use it against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes."},

However, the facility was revoked in 2010 after the previous regime did not agree to accept the condition laid by the EU to renew the GSP+. Sri Lanka obtained GSP+ following a 7-year hiatus following a thorough process after the current government came into power in 2015. The EU diplomats believe that Sri Lanka receives an economic benefit of nearly 300 million euros through the GSP+ concession.
